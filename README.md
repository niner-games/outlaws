If you are at least in your forties and you ever had your own IBM, Tandy, Amiga or Atari ST... If you still remember what was the difference between CGA, EGA and VGA graphic cards... You could possible heard about "Lost Dutchman Mine" game published in 1989 by Magnetic Images.

If you don't know any of these, but you fancy on playing poker, picking gold in the mines, eating fried rattlesnakes or capture wanted outlaws, all the way across the burning desert, fighting thirst, hunger and Indians then... you are certianly in the right place.

We, at Niner Games, love this game and similar climax. And we have decided to resurrect, revive, reboot or whatever this beautiful game, one of the first survival games in the game industry history.
